# monitor-stuff

## A collection of monitor controlling repos

I'm trying to collect the code I've found that controls monitors into a single
place.

The most useful thing, IMO, is the display-switch repo. I'd love to get the
capabilities of MonitorControl combined with this, so I can control both
brightness and input from my keyboard (I have multiple devices connected to
single monitors in multiple places)
